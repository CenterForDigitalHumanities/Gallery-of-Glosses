    title: "Purpose",
    summary: `Gallery of Glosses is a project that aims to make glosses on authoritative texts more accessible to scholars. 
    Hundreds of thousands of glosses appear in medieval and other manuscripts. Many of these glosses remain hidden away in 
    manuscripts in remote places or, even if they exist in digitized manuscripts, remain difficult to read or difficult to 
    find. This site publishes glosses that scholars have transcribed and provides some essential data related to each gloss, 
    including the textual witness(es) or manuscript(s) where it was found, what work it is glossing, and what language it 
    is in.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Studying Glosses",
    summary: `Medievalists of all disciplines frequently come across glosses in copies of works they are studying; Gallery of Glosses 
    aims to facilitate research on the glosses themselves. These glosses testify to the vibrant and also sometimes mundane 
    reading and studying of authoritative texts in medieval communities and by individuals. In many cases, the authors of the 
    glosses remain anonymous; in other cases, they are figures of import whose work became authoritative in their own right. In 
    both cases, these glosses constitute evidence of knowledge creation and transmission, modes of thought, and hermeneutical 
    trends.`
  },
  {
    title: "Extent",
    summary: `Gallery of Glosses is not limited to genre, language, or time period. The intention is to see the glosses 
    available to researchers grow to include hundreds of glosses on authoritative philosophical texts (e.g., Aristotle’s 
    <cite>De anima</cite>), theological texts (e.g., Thomas Aquinas’s <cite>Summa theologiae</cite>), scriptural texts 
    (e.g., the Epistle to the Romans), legal texts (e.g., Justinian’s <cite>Codex</cite>), literary texts (e.g., 
    <cite>Beowulf</cite>), and more.`

    target="_blank">glossing.rerum.io</a>. That site is where scholars can go if they want to contribute glosses to Gallery of 
    Glosses. A user account is required to work in the data-management platform wing of Gallery of Glosses; this public site 
    is open and available for browsing to anyone.`

  {
    title: "Introduction",
    summary:
      "This project has benefited from two internal grants from Saint Louis University (SLU) and one external grant from the American Philosophical Society (APS). It began with an intention to create an analogue edition of early twelfth-century glosses on the gospel of Matthew, prior to the formation c.1200 of the Glossa ordinaria on the Bible.",
  },
  {
    title: "Initial Funding and Research (2019)",
    summary:
      "The project received a Franklin Research Grant from the APS amounting to $4,000, and a Summer Research Award in the Humanities from SLU amounting to $6,390. The objective was to acquire more digital manuscript copies of glossed Matthews and work on transcribing glosses. Eventually, Larson and Cuba decided to expand the project's scope, envisioning a digital humanities infrastructure for multiple medieval authoritative texts.",
  },
  {
    title: "President's Research Fund Award (2020)",
    summary:
      "A 13-month grant of $21,000 was awarded. With this funding, more manuscript copies were purchased and two graduate student summer workers were employed for transcription. Additionally, Cuba and Haberberger developed digital humanities tools and platforms. There was refinement of the transcription software TPEN, development of a data-management tool titled “Glossing Matthew”, and plans were made for a public-facing web application.",
  },
  {
    title: "Research Outcomes",
    summary:
      'The project achieved a complete transcription of glosses on Matthew 5 from sixteen twelfth-century manuscripts. Data was organized on the Glossing Matthew GitHub site. Patrick Cuba and Bryan Haberberger presented a paper titled "Building a IIIF-Aware Ecosystem" at the IIIF Annual Conference on June 23, 2021. A draft research article by Atria A. Larson was submitted to the journal Quaderni di storia religiosa medievale. Additionally, a poster titled "Digital Humanities Tools for Capturing Glosses on Authoritative Texts" was accepted for the 16th International Congress of Medieval Canon Law in July 2022.',
  },
  {
    title: "Future Directions",
    summary:
      "The next iteration will transition from “Glossing Matthew” to the “Gallery of Glosses.” This will involve a broader use of manuscripts, refinement of transcription processes, and continued utilization of manuscripts of Matthew for transcription. The project will also collaborate with Saint Louis University’s Vatican Film Library (VFL) for research in medieval canon law and partner with the Walter J. Ong Center for Digital Humanities for ongoing projects.",
