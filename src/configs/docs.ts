    title: "Purpose",
    summary: `Gallery of Glosses is a project that aims to make glosses on authoritative texts more accessible to scholars. 
    Hundreds of thousands of glosses appear in medieval and other manuscripts. Many of these glosses remain hidden away in 
    manuscripts in remote places or, even if they exist in digitized manuscripts, remain difficult to read or difficult to 
    find. This site publishes glosses that scholars have transcribed and provides some essential data related to each gloss, 
    including the textual witness(es) or manuscript(s) where it was found, what work it is glossing, and what language it 
    is in.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Studying Glosses",
    summary: `Medievalists of all disciplines frequently come across glosses in copies of works they are studying; Gallery of Glosses 
    aims to facilitate research on the glosses themselves. These glosses testify to the vibrant and also sometimes mundane 
    reading and studying of authoritative texts in medieval communities and by individuals. In many cases, the authors of the 
    glosses remain anonymous; in other cases, they are figures of import whose work became authoritative in their own right. In 
    both cases, these glosses constitute evidence of knowledge creation and transmission, modes of thought, and hermeneutical 
    trends.`
  },
  {
    title: "Extent",
    summary: `Gallery of Glosses is not limited to genre, language, or time period. The intention is to see the glosses 
    available to researchers grow to include hundreds of glosses on authoritative philosophical texts (e.g., Aristotle’s 
    <cite>De anima</cite>), theological texts (e.g., Thomas Aquinas’s <cite>Summa theologiae</cite>), scriptural texts 
    (e.g., the Epistle to the Romans), legal texts (e.g., Justinian’s <cite>Codex</cite>), literary texts (e.g., 
    <cite>Beowulf</cite>), and more.`

    target="_blank">glossing.rerum.io</a>. That site is where scholars can go if they want to contribute glosses to Gallery of 
    Glosses. A user account is required to work in the data-management platform wing of Gallery of Glosses; this public site

    title: "Projects",
    summary: `<p>Of greatest relevance to glosses is the <a href="http://www.glossing.org/" target="_blank">Network for the 
    Study of Glossing</a>, of which Pádraic Moran is a lead organizer and contributor. The website includes links to many 
    online editions of glosses, mostly from particular manuscripts on particular works.</p> 

    <p>Dr. Moran is also currently directing a project called <a href="http://glossam.ie/" target="_blank">GLOSSAM</a> 
    (Global and Local Scholarship on Annotated Manuscripts). This project has many of the same aims as Gallery of 
    Glosses but works from a different data structure. The data structure of Gallery of Glosses prioritizes the individual 
    gloss, to which there may be one or many witnesses, which makes it apt for the recording of data on individual glosses 
    or small groups of glosses as well glosses that exist in multiple manuscript witnesses. The data structure of GLOSSAM 
    prioritizes the manuscript witness, making it apt for the transcription of all glosses in a particular manuscript. 
    Scholars interested in publishing gloss transcriptions in a digital platform can decide which program best suits their 
    scholarly goals.</p>

    <p><a href="https://ccl.rch.uky.edu/" target="_blank">The Carolingian Canon Law Project</a>, created by Abigail Firey, is 
    a searchable, electronic rendition of works of canon law used by Carolingian readers. Individual manuscript copies of 
    these works may be glossed. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://scta.info/" target="_blank">Scholastic Commentaries and Texts 
    Archive</a> and the <a href="https://scta.lombardpress.org/" target="_blank">SCTA Reading Room</a>, the creation of 
    Jeffrey C. Witt, include all manner of texts in the scholastic tradition in innovative digital editions. Gallery of 
    Glosses can accommodate references to such digital sites to identify the texts that are being glossed and enable users 
    to pull up an edition of the text being glossed in tandem with the gloss on that text.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.digitaldecretals.com/home" target="_blank">The Digital Decretals</a> is a project of Edward Reno. 
    It renders into electronic form Bernard of Parma’s gloss commentary on the <cite>Liber extra</cite>, the first official 
    and exclusive collection of canon law for the Catholic Church, which is recognized as the <cite>Glossa ordinaria</cite> 
    on that text. The version reproduced is that of the <cite>Editio romana</cite> of the <cite>Corpus iuris canonici</cite> 
    (1582). The site provides Word and PDF versions of the glosses, with standardized citations to the Roman law and canon 
    law texts referenced therein. Gallery of Glosses is partnering with the Digital Decretals and incorporating all these 
    glosses into our database.</p>`

  {
    title: "Introduction",
    summary:
    `Gallery of Glosses is a digital humanities project that was born in the traditional world of scholarship with 
    the aim of producing an analogue, print edition. The focus of study was glosses on the Gospel of Matthew. Early 
    research indicated that project would only be worthwhile and advance scholarship beyond what was readily available 
    in the <cite>editio princeps</cite> of the <cite>Glossa ordinaria</cite> of Adolph Rusch (1480/81) if textual 
    development of the glosses in twelfth-century manuscripts was discernible. In fact, such textual development was 
    discernible, but the complex array of variant glosses and numbers of glosses and positions of glosses created 
    seemingly insurmountable obstacles to a print edition. More to the point, a print edition with standard 
    <cite>apparatus</cite> seemed insufficient and not the ideal format in which to present the data. As a result, the 
    project turned into a digital humanities one.`

    title: "Prototyping",
    summary:
    `In 2020, Atria Larson, with the support and partnership of Patrick Cuba, won an internal research grant from Saint 
    Louis University, a President’s Research Fund award. The grant allowed the creation of “Glossing Matthew,” where the 
    test case for the first RERUM platform for recording glosses consisted of glosses from sixteen twelfth-century 
    manuscripts on Matthew 5. This grant served as seed funding to demonstrate proof of concept that could be beneficial 
    in applications for an external award.`
  },
  {
    title: "The Gospel of Matthew",
    summary:
    `<p>The external grant application expanded “Glossing Matthew” into “Gallery of Glosses.” The intent was to open the 
    platform to multiple genres of text and ensure that the workflow of the data-management platform facilitated usage 
    by scholars in different disciplines working with glosses on different kinds of texts. The grant application for a 
    Level II Digital Humanities Advancement Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities was successful; it was 
    awarded in August 2022.</p>
    
    <p>The two-year grant funded significant development work on the RERUM site, the creation of large amounts of data in 
    the form of hundreds of transcribed glosses with attendant data, and this first iteration of a public-facing website. 
    The grant also supported the participation of a group of external test users. All of them have expertise in digital 
    humanities and an interest in glosses, and they come from different disciplines. These participants provided feedback 
    in the second year of the grant through an online meeting and in-person workshops and a panel at the 11th Annual 
    Symposium on Medieval and Renaissance Studies at Saint Louis University, June 10-12, 2024. Additionally, the grant 
    funded travel to and a presentation on Gallery of Glosses to the world of canon law scholarship at the 17th 
    International Congress of Medieval Canon Law, held in Canterbury, England in July 2024.</p>`,
